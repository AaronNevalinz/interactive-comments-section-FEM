## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

##### 1. Dynamic HTML Generation: 
The code demonstrates how to generate HTML dynamically based on data fetched from an external source (in this case, a JSON file). This is crucial for creating dynamic and interactive web applications where content needs to be updated or generated based on user interactions or data changes.

##### 2. Event Handling: 
The code shows how to handle events such as clicking on plus buttons to increase scores and clicking on reply buttons to initiate the reply functionality. Event handling is fundamental for creating interactive web pages and applications where user actions trigger specific behaviors or actions.

##### 3. DOM Manipulation: 
The code involves manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) by adding, removing, or modifying elements dynamically. DOM manipulation is essential for updating the appearance and behavior of web pages based on user interactions, data changes, or application state.

##### 4. Nested Structures Handling: 
The code demonstrates how to handle nested data structures, such as comments and their replies, in the HTML generation process. It recursively generates HTML for nested comments, enabling the display of threaded or nested comments in the comments section.

##### 5. Form Submission and Data Handling: 
The code includes handling form submissions for replying to comments. It captures user input from the reply form, processes the submitted data (in this case, logging it to the console), and potentially sends it to a server for further processing or storage.

##### 6. Error Handling and Validation: 
Although not extensively covered in the provided code, error handling and validation are critical aspects of web development. Ensuring that elements exist before accessing them, validating user input, and handling errors gracefully contribute to creating robust and user-friendly web applications.
